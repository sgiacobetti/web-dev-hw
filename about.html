      <p>I chose this project because I love guacomle, both eating and making it. My mom taugh me how to make guacamole when I was younger, and I always make it during the summer with her and my sisters. It is something that brings me sweet memories and smiles.You can learn more about making guacomle on cooking sites, but alos in your own home. Do not be afraid to experiment with new ingredients and put your own twist on this classic home recipie.</p>
