A page can only have one document head and body element. The head allows the viewers to see your actions, but they can not see what you are thinking/planning. The body includes everything that you want your page viewers to see. Whatever you want visible should be put into the body.
Semantic elements describes the elements meaning to the browser and the developer, instead of just displaying it, which structural elements do. They can define parts of a web page, like sections, times, headers and footers.
I had alot of difficult with this assignment. My computer crashed and I am also completely out of storage on my laptop, so It took me a while to work around and it and find enough storage to do this.

I chose a recipe that wasnt too lengthy, but still difficult enough to provide information and learning aspects for the reader.
