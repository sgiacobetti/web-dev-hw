My imaginary client is an outdoor recreational activities company that takes people out in nature and guides them on activities such as hiking, backpacking and snowboarding trips. Their site needs are to be easy and simple to navigate, to give users so knowledge about parks and to show their services.

Display inline displays a certain element as an inline element and width and height properties will not effect it. Inline-block properties displays elements as an inline-block container. Width and height elements can be applied. Block displays starts on a new line and takes up the entire width.

My work cycle involved first scanning over the assignment, and then figuring out what theme I wanted my website to have/ who my clientele will be. I then researched how to put in all the different codes and code different properties and element. Then, I inputted the elements and began building the site.
