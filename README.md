My experience learning about HTML has been a crazy rollercoaster. Learning HTML has been extremely difficult for me. I was very new to everything having to do with HTML and coding, so it was very overwhelming. It is difficult to learn and keep track of all the different coding equations. However, I am very glad that I am learning all about it because i believe it may be useful in my career in the future.
I am anxious about everything to do with CSS because I do not know anything about it. I am excited to expand my knowledge on web design though. Again, I find it useful and somewhat interesting.
I started off thinking of the topic i wanted to teach and write about. I then read through the assignment guidelines. Them, i did alot of research and learned how to do the different coding equations and then proceeded to put those equations into my information.
