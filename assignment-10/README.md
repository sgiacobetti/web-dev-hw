I chose a few different fonts. I chose an italic font and a regular standard font. I also used Times New Roman because it is a very classic font to use in general.
A web safe font ensure maximum compatibility between web browsers. If a certain browser does not support that font, it will generate the next workable font. System fonts boost performance because the browser does not ave to download any font files. It matches what the operating system is currently using. With a font stack, you can determine the fonts you want and then turn it into a font-family property so you don't have a long list of fonts every single time.
My work cycle was same as always. I read over the instructions and any tutorials given to me. I then did research on the different coding addresses and equations. After this, I found my written excerpt and I began to code. Again, this was extremely difficulty for me, but I truly am trying my hardest to learn.
