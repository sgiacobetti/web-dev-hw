Some forms i have come across while browsing the web are input elements. Different input elements define different things. For example, the text input element defines a one-line text whee as the radio input defines a selection of multiple choices.
Text input: Fist and Last names- put in lists, under contact pages, etc.
Selection Input: Checkbox, Radio- users select one option out of a limited number of options in radio, in checkbox users can select none, or multiple, options out of a limited number of options
Button Input: a "Click Me" button: buttons that allow uses to click and bring them somewhere; draws the users attention
I kept my design somewhat simple. My table was just two columns with multiple rows, which made it informative, yet easy to read. I put in a "Click Me" button to add attention and some interactiveness to the piece. I made my responses and questions in the form elements relevant to things I like, and made them unique as well.
