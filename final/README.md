I learned a lot about web development, in fact, everything I currently know and have learned about web development has been through this class. i have learned about grouping repositories. I am still pretty confused about GitHub...however. I still need to learn more about GitHub and things like that.
I learned so much about how to code colors, how to choose fonts and do things like bold and italicize words. I even learned how to add in and display images, create tables and even do things like make fill in text boxes and create sumbit buttons. I have learned so much, but I have also made alot of mistakes. I know that making mistakes is the biggest learning curve and that learning from my mistakes is the best way to learn something new.
My work cycle included re learning all about coding because I have made alot of mistakes and i wanted to make sure i came out of this course knwing as much as i could about coding, granted there is still so much i do not know. I tried my hardest to apply my self and what i learned and attempted to code my won site. Seeing things come together was extremely rewarding to me, its pretty cool. I did struggle alot, especially with the drop down menu, but i think i got it down in the end. Thank you so much for bearing with me, I do promise i am trying my hardest and putting forth my best effort in the class.
