I went to youtube.com on the Wayback Machine. It looked very outdated and less fancy. There were a lot more block structures used, more easy shapes. Also the colors were very simple and minimal, basically just red, black and white. The logo was rounded and blocked, as apposed to todays more strait lighned, modern logo.
GIT Module was extremely difficult for me. Unfortunatly, I still do not fully understand it, although I am trying very hard to. I am struggling very hard to understand it and find my way around.
