A div tag defines a specific section in an HTML document. Classes are used to define and sort element styles with the same class name. Elements within the same class attribute have the same styles and formatting. Ids explains a specific id for an HTML element. Spans are used to expand and format elements in HTML.
"Alt text" provides alternative information for a specific picture if the person viewing the picture can not open or see it. It allows us to see the image if problems like slow connection arise.
My work cycle was very difficult. I did a lot of research about how to actually code these certain HTML elements, and got a lot of different formats so that confused me. I first found all my information for my song and then began to code. Coding is extremely confusing and difficult for me. I need some in person help I think.
